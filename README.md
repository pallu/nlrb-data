## Data Limitations
1. The data starts around 2010. See https://github.com/labordata/nlrb-cats/ for data from the previous system
2. The update process starts by downloading a CSV of all the cases within a specified time period from the nlrb.gov website. However, repeatingly requesting the same information from nlrb.gov results in spreadsheets with slightly different contents. We might be a bit out of date if the last CSV we downloaded missed a recent case.
